# mechanism.py - mechanism class for implementing TX-TL mechanisms
# RMM, 16 Aug 2018
#
# Mechanisms the means by which all reactions in a TX-TL reaction are
# established.  Mechanisms can be overridden to allow specialized
# processing of core reactions (eg, adding additional detail, using
# simplified models, etc.
#
# Mechanisms are established in the following order (lower levels
# override higher levels):
#
# Default extract mechanisms
#   Default mechanisms
#       Mechanisms passed to Component() [eg DNA Assembly]
#         Mechanisms based to Sub) [eg, DNA elements]
#
# This hierarchy allows reactions to be created without the user
# having to specify any alternative mechanisms (defaults will be
# used), but also allows the user to override all mechanisms used for
# every (e.g, by giving an alternative transcription
# mechanisms when setting up an extract) or individual mechanisms for
# a given (by passing an alternative mechanism just to that
# .
