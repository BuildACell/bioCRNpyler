"""Global mechanisms are a lot like mechanisms. They are called only by mixtures
   on a list of all species have been generated by components. Global mechanisms
   are meant to work as universal mechanisms that function on each species or
   all species of some material type or with some attribute. Global mechanisms
   may only act on one species at a time.

 In order to decide which species a global mechanism acts upon, the filter_dict
    is used.
        filter_dict[species.material_type / species.attributes] = True / False
   For each species, its material type or attributes are sent through the
   filter_dict. If True is returned, the GlobalMechanism will act on the
   species. If False is returned, the the GlobalMechanism will not be called.
   If filter_dict[attribute] is different from filter_dict[material_type],
   filter_dict[attribute] takes precedent. If multiple filter_dict[attribute]
   contradict for different attributes, an error is raised. 

   For ComplexSpecies, filter based upon all subspecies.type. If there is a conflict, 
   raise a warning and go with the default.

 If the species's name, material type, and attributes are all not in the
    filter_dict, the GlobalMechanism will be called if default_on == True and
    not called if default_on == False.

 Note that the above filtering is done automatically. Any parameters needed by
    the global mechanism must be in the Mixture's parameter dictionary. These
    methods are assumed to take a single species as input.

 An example of a global mechanism is degradation via dilution which is
    demonstrated in the Tests folder.

 GlobalMechanisms should be used cautiously or avoided alltogether - the order
    in which they are called may have to be carefully user defined in the
    subclasses of Mixture in order to ensure expected behavior.
