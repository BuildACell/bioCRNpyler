    "### 1. Introduction\n",
    "BioCRNpyler is a software tool designed to rapidly compile large biological chemical reaction networks (CRNs) from simple user specifications (written in python). It has built in support of a number of models for transcription, translation, and gene expression regulation using components common in _E. coli_ synthetic biology. This tutorial explains the inner workings of BioCRNpyler and shows how to create custom mixtures, components, and mechanisms. Specifically, we will go through making a custom gene expression model:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    ">$G \\to G + P \\rightleftharpoons G:P \\to G + P + X$\n",
    "\n",
    "here $G$ is a gene and $P$ is a polymerase and $X$ is the protein expressed by $G$. No translational machinery is included in this model, making it one of the simplest possible for expression. Note that we are ignoring translation for simplicitiy, not becuase it isn't important.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the top level, BioCRNpyler uses three kinds of objects:\n",
    "* __Mechanisms__: are the details of how a physics process is implemented as a CRN. These take the form of black box reaction schemas which compile into a CRN containing all the intermediate steps required to get from a specified input to an output.\n",
    "* __Components__: are the ingredients one might imagine adding to a test tube, say from a pipette. They do not include all chemical species involved in a reaction, but just the key ones we might experimentally modulate. Components may contain their own mechanisms or default to those used by a mixture. An example of a component is a piece of DNA encoding a gene. A DNA-Transcription factor complex, on the other hand, would not normally be a component.\n",
    "* __Mixtures__: can be thought of as the \"reaction soup\" we are working in. Mixtures contain default components and mechanisms. Components are added to mixtures to create different reaction conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, BioCRNpyler tells the Mixture to compile all its Components. Each Component contains its own Mechanisms (or defaults to Mechanisms defined in the Mixture) and calls each Mechanism (read: reaction schema) to generate a set of chemical species and reactions which are combined into a complete CRN. BioCRNpyler also has its own internal CRN representation, which we will discuss next."

    "### Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) model\n",
    "A CRN is a set of species $S$ and a set of reactions $R$ where each reaction is expressed $I \\rightarrow O$ where $I$ are the inputs species, $O$ are the output species. Each reaction occurs with a rate function (propensity) $\\rho(x)$ which takes the state of the CRN (the values of all the species) as an input. By default, reactions use massaction rates: $\\rho(x) = k  \\Pi_{s \\in I} x_s$ here $k$ is some constant and $x_s$ is the value of the species $s$. A number of built in propensities exist and are described in the documentation, including a general propensity allowing for an arbitrary function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Internally, BioCRNpyler represents species as strings involving a type identifier and a name: type_name. This is to allow for species to be identified as \"gene_X\", \"mrna_X\", etc. Complexes between species can be created automatically using the ComplexSpecies constructor or given custom defined names. By default, a complex of gene_X and protein_Y would be called complex_gene_X_protein_Y. This would be considered different from complex_protein_Y_gene_X in Bioscrape's CRN semantics because species here are effectively strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reactions are stored as lists of species (for the inputs and outputs) and a rate constant k. Non massaction reactions also require a parameter dictionary of their relevant parameter values. Massaction reactions are allowed to be reversible, in which case they are thought of as two irreversible reactions. Reaction rates default to 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we will create the CRN described above directly and approximate it with a non-massaction propensity."
