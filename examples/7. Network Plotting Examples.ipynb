    "The plotting package allows you to make an interactive CRN plot. Plotting requires the [Bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/installation.html) and [ForceAtlas2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679) libraries to be installed on your machine. Bokeh is used for plotting, ForceAtlas2 is used for graph layout. To install, type the following into the consol:\n",
